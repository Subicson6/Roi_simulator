Invoicing ROI Simulator - Project Plan


This document outlines the planned approach, architecture, and technologies for building the Invoicing ROI Simulator as per the project requirements.

üöÄ 1. Planned Approach & Architecture
I will build this application using a simple and robust client-server architecture.

Frontend (Client): A single-page application built in React. This will handle the user interface, including the input form for the calculator and the display area for the results. When the user enters data or requests a report, the React app will send a request to the backend API.

Backend (Server): A REST API built in Python using the Flask framework. This will be the "brain" of the application. It will handle all business logic, including:

Receiving input data from the React frontend.

Performing all the ROI calculations using the specified formulas and internal constants.

Connecting to the MySQL database to save, retrieve, and list scenarios.

Generating a report and handling the email gate.

Database: A MySQL database will be used to store the saved scenarios. It will contain a single table to hold the user's input data and the associated scenario name.

This separation makes the application easy to develop, test, and manage.

üíª 2. Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries
Here is the list of technologies I intend to use:

Frontend:

Language: JavaScript

Framework: React.js

HTTP Client: axios for making API requests to the backend.

Backend:

Language: Python

Framework: Flask (A lightweight and beginner-friendly framework for building APIs).

Libraries:

flask-cors: To handle cross-origin requests from the React app.

mysql-connector-python: To connect the Python application to the MySQL database.

fpdf2 or reportlab: To generate the PDF report server-side.

Database:

System: MySQL Server

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Key Features and Functionality
The application will include the following core features as required:

Interactive ROI Calculator: A form where users can input their business metrics (monthly_invoice_volume, num_ap_staff, etc.). The results (monthly_savings, roi_percentage, payback_months) will be calculated and displayed instantly on the screen.

Scenario Management:

Save: Users can save their calculation inputs with a unique scenario_name.

Load: Users can retrieve a previously saved scenario to view its details.

List: Users can see a list of all saved scenarios.

Email-Gated Report Generation:

A feature to download a PDF summary of the calculation results.

This will be "gated," meaning the user must enter an email address before the download begins. The backend will handle the report generation.
